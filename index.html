            <p>My background:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Education</li>
                    <p>I started school in 2004 at Wankan Academy(Zimmerman) and finished primary
                        education at Wankan Academy(Ruiru). I then attended high school at Nova Pioneer
                        where i finished last year, afterwhich i took a short break and attended Moringa.
                    </p>
                <li>Personal</li>
                    <p>I was born in 2001, to my mother and father, who are very ineteresting people. 
                        They both have their own means of thinking but can agree on most things regarding
                        my safety which I think is a good thing, as it makes them very prepared people.
                    </p>
                <li>Reason for applying</li>
                    <p>I have no noble reason such as empowering women, i just wanted to improve my coding
                       skills in order to make websites that aid me in my objectives like helping people learn
                       how to draw manga and even post their own work to receive feedback. I also loved using
                       computers from a young age, this way I can be productive and still do what I enjoy</p>
            </ol> 
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>As for my hobbies I have a few, namely:
